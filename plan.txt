Creating Wilson's method
    1. user clicks a starting box/coordinate
    2. program selects a random box/coordinate that is not in the defined path
    3. program uses the random walk theory to find its way to the box/coordinate defined in step 2. If it encounters a box/coordinate that it has already checked in its random walk, it will cut out the loop created.
    4. the boxes chosen in the random walk path will have their walls altered to create the walls of the box.
    5. once the coordinate in step 2 is reached, repeat step 2-4 until all the boxes are a part of the maze
